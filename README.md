# **Car Quiz**

![Sudoku Board]()

You can see the live website [here]().

The purpose of this website to provide the user with a fun and challenging game to test their knowledge of cars.

My aim for this quiz was to make a simple and easy to use UI that allows the user to focus on the game. I wanted to be able to randomise the questions so the user can play multiple times. Finally, I wanted this website to be responsive, so that users on all devices can enjoy the completed website.

## **Planning**
![Project Ideas](/project_ideas.png)

I started my planning by coming up with 2 ideas. These were hangman and sudoku. I the proceded to plan the flow of each using Lucidchart. This allowed me to get an idea about how I would develop each idea.

After reviewing my plans, I decided to make this project a sudoku game. I decided this because I wanted to make a challenging game which people can play multiple times.
